# Git and GitHub Learning Repository

Welcome to my Git and GitHub learning repository! This repository contains my notes, cheatsheets, and detailed explanations about Git and GitHub.

## Repository Structure

- **Cheatsheet**: This folder contains quick reference guides for Git and GitHub commands and workflows.
- **Topic Wise Notes**: This folder includes detailed explanations of various Git and GitHub topics.

## What I've Learned

### Git Basics

- Git is a popular version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
- It's used for tracking code changes, managing who made changes, and facilitating coding collaboration.

### Key Git Concepts

1. **Repositories**: Projects managed by Git.
2. **Cloning**: Creating a local copy of a project.
3. **Staging and Committing**: Controlling and tracking changes.
4. **Branching and Merging**: Working on different parts and versions of a project.
5. **Pulling**: Getting the latest version of a project.
6. **Pushing**: Updating the main project with local changes.

### Git Workflow

1. Initialize a repository
2. Make changes to files
3. Stage modified files
4. Commit staged files
5. View commit history
6. Revert to previous commits if needed

### Benefits of Git

- Widely used (over 70% of developers)
- Enables global collaboration
- Provides full project history
- Allows reverting to earlier versions

### GitHub

- GitHub is a platform that provides tools built on top of Git.
- It's the largest host of source code in the world, owned by Microsoft since 2018.
