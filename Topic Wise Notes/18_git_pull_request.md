# Git GitHub Send Pull Request

## Push Changes to Our GitHub Fork
We have made a lot of changes to our local Git.

Now we push them to our GitHub fork:

commit the changes:

```
git push origin
```
Go to GitHub, and we see that the repository has a new commit. And we can send a Pull Request to the original repository
* Click `Pull request` and create a pull request
* Remember to add an explanation for the administrators.
* Click on `Create pull request`
* Pull Request is sent.

## Approving Pull Requests

* Now any member with access can see the Pull Request when they see the original repository
* And they can see the proposed changes
* Comment on the changes and `merge`
* Confirm
* And changes have been `merged` with `master`.
